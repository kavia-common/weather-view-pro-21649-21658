# Weather Frontend (Angular)

This is the Angular 17 (standalone) frontend for Weather View Pro.

- Development: npm start (serves on http://localhost:3000)
- Build: npm run build (outputs to dist/weather-frontend)
- Preview/Docker: The Dockerfile launches npm start by default for preview.

Scripts:
- npm start -> ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
- npm run build -> ng build

Notes:
- The app was migrated from Next.js; any remaining Next.js artifacts under out/ can be ignored or cleaned later.
